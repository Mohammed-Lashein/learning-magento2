                    It is a bit weird that in the above class attribute on using the
                    value 'Magento\Framework\View\Element\Text' I got an error saying
                    that that value doesn't match the pattern expected by magento (
                    where the string should not start with \) .

                    I reviewed the page.xml that we created in the previous chapter homework and found that the FQCN started with a \ and
                    everything worked with no problems .

                    After insepcting the writer's code, I found that he didn't use
                    the \ in any block name, so maybe I have to follow his path .
